 * The receiving half of SCTP (RFC 4960), as much as a WebRTC data channel
 * needs when the browser only sends.
 *
 * The console opens one channel with negotiated id 0, unordered and without
 * retransmission, so there is no channel-open handshake (RFC 8832) and the
 * device never sends DATA: it answers the association setup, acknowledges
 * what arrives, follows FORWARD-TSN past what the browser gave up on, and
 * hands each message up as it comes. One SCTP packet travels in one DTLS
 * record, both ways.
