 * Tell the browser's H.264 decoder that frames are never reordered.

 * The encoder writes no B-frames, but its SPS does not say so: the VUI has no
 * bitstream_restriction. A decoder then holds frames back before showing any -
 * about a second over WebRTC, measured. The console does the same for the
 * WebSocket in web/src/video/spsPatch.ts; over WebRTC the browser decodes on
 * its own, so the SPS is fixed here before it is sent.
 *
 * Only the layout this encoder writes is handled (Baseline, VUI, no HRD).
