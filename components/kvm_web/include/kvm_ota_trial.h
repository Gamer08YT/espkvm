 * the device can serve a page, not that the person who updated it can still
 * reach it: a broken VPN, Wi-Fi or TLS leaves a device that looks fine from the
 * inside and is lost from the outside. An update installed "on trial" stays
 * unconfirmed until a console says it works. If nobody does within the time
 * given, the device goes back to the previous image.
