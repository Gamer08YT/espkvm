 * HDMI audio. The capture bridge pulls the sound out of the HDMI stream and
 * sends it as I2S - bit clock, word clock, data - on three wires to three GPIOs
 * the operator picks. This device is the I2S slave: the bridge drives both
 * clocks, so the rate is whatever the source plays, read from the bridge.
 *
 * The receiver runs only while someone reads. Each reader gets its own queue of
 * 5 ms blocks, so a slow one (the SD card) never holds up a fast one (the
 * network); when a queue is full the oldest block goes. No source, no clocks or
 * a rate change are not errors: reads time out until sound comes again.
 *
 * Settings: aud_enable, aud_bclk, aud_ws, aud_din. Based on Zachary Leahan's
 * kvm_audio in the espkvm-xbox fork.
